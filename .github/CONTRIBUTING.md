Contributing to the Joomla Component Builder Snippets (JCBS)
===============
You are welcome to submit a contribution for review and possible inclusion in the Joomla Component Builder Snippets but, before it will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple steps:

1) Open an issue on GitHub. If you can, please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead; this will automatically create an issue for you so you do not have to create an issue if you are creating a pull request.

2) Follow the [Correct Json Format](https://jsonlint.com/), if you used JCB to build the file it should be okay.

3) When you do a pull request make sure your staging branch it uptodate with the main staging branch. 

4) Report security issues to the JCBS! Core Team using the [Report security issues contact form](https://www.vdm.io/report-security-issues). Please do not use the public forums for security issues.

Please be patient as not all items will be tested immediately (remember, all bug testing for the JCB Sbippets are done by volunteers) and be receptive to feedback about your code.

#### Branches
PRs should usually be made to the `staging` branch as this contains the most recent version of the code.
