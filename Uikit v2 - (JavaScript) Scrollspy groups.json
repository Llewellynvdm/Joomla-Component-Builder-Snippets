    "description": "You can also group scrollspy elements, so you won't have to apply the data attribute to each of them. Just add the data-uk-scollspy\"{target:'MY-CLASS'}\" attribute to a container element, targetting the selector the items you want to animate within the container. When using a delay it will be applied cumulatively to the items within the row that scrolls into view. The delay will be resetted for the next row within the group when it scrolls into view.",
    "usage": "The scrollspy component listens to page scrolling and triggers events based on the scroll position. For example, if you scroll down a page and an element appears the first time in the viewport you can trigger a smooth animation to fade in the element. Just add the data-uk-scrollspy attribute and the following options.",
