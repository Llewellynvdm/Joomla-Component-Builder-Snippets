    "description": "The switcher can also be applied to buttons or button groups from the Button component. Just add the switcher data attribute to a  element around a group of buttons or to the element with the .button-group class.",
    "usage": "The switcher component consists of a number of toggles and their related content items. Add the data-uk-switcher=\"{connect:'#ID'}\" attribute to the element which contains the toggles, targetting the same id as is used on the element containing the content items. Add the .uk-switcher class to the same element. Typically the switcher is combined with other components, some of which will be shown here.",
