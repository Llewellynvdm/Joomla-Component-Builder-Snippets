    "description": "The Switcher component allows you to add different animations to items when toggling between them. All you need to do is add the animation parameter to the data-attribute and define the animation that you want to apply. Check the table below for an overview of the animations provided.\r\n\r\nYou can also apply multiple animations by using the uk-animation-* classes from the Animation component. That way you can even create your own custom class to apply a different transition to the switcher.",
    "usage": "The switcher component consists of a number of toggles and their related content items. Add the data-uk-switcher=\"{connect:'#ID'}\" attribute to the element which contains the toggles, targetting the same id as is used on the element containing the content items. Add the .uk-switcher class to the same element. Typically the switcher is combined with other components, some of which will be shown here.",
    "snippet": "<!-- This is the container of the toggling elements -->\r\n<ul data-uk-switcher=\"{connect:'#my-id', animation: 'uk-animation-fade, uk-animation-slide-left'}\">\r\n    <li><a href=\"\">...<\/a><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<!-- This is the container of the content items -->\r\n<ul id=\"my-id\" class=\"uk-switcher\">\r\n    <li>...<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>",
